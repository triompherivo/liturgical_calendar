You enter a date (normally a sunday but the application is able to position to the nearest sunday). 
Then it will be able to set the Taom-piangonana (Set)
the name of Pericope (ex Trinity + 5 Alahady faha 5 manaraka ny trinite)
The color of the alter 
and of course the readings (testamenta taloha, lektiona, filazantsara, toriteny )
I didn't finish to enter all the readings ....time consuming but it's a PROOF OF CONCEPT ...it is working i tried with some dates in 2028,2027, 2024 and i compared with android app like "MASINA"
